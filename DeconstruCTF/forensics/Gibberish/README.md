Description: `NASA receive a weird transmission yesterday but they were't able to decode it. I mean, it's just a bunch of gibberish. The only thing they have cracked was one word "goodbye". They have no clue what that means though. Can you help them?`<br>

I downloaded the attached file [flag.txt](https://github.com/azooztba/CTF-writeups/blob/main/DeconstruCTF/forensics/Gibberish/resourses/flag.txt). after looking at the contents of the file it looked like it have been encoded.<br>
So i went to [cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/) and used the magic tool on the file as in this img:<br>
